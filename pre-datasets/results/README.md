## Results folder

This folder contains the results of the simulations.
After running the simulations, the results are stored
in this folder. Each file contains the results of the
simulations for a specific scenario.
The files are named as follows:

+ `qos_<g>.dat`: this file contains the QoS metrics for each combination
+ `rewards_<g>.dat`: this file contains the rewards for each combination of states and actions to run.
